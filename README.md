# Clue Step Timer

A RuneLite plugin that times each clue scroll step.

## How it works
- Starts timing when you **Read/Open** a clue scroll
- Stops when the **next clue scroll** is received or a **casket** is obtained
- Prints the step time in chat

## Notes
- No automation
- No input modification
- Timing and display only
